# Genetic-based-Load-Balancing-Cloud-Computing 
   Abstract— Job scheduling is a very significant aspect of cloud computing. Different kinds of services are provided to the consumers within desirable throughput. A lot of optimization techniques emerged to enhance efficiency and reduce expenses. This paper provides an approach to an online mode heuristic algorithm named as ‘Genetic Algorithm’ and its comparison with the batch mode heuristic algorithms. Cloudsim is used to perform the simulation. The results of the simulation show that the Genetic algorithm performs well compared to First Come First Serve Algorithm, Round Robin Algorithm, and Shortest Job First algorithm.
